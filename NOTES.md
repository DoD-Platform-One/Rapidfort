# RapidFort Notes

- rf-version-info ConfigMap: Need information on data that is needed to populate this ConfigMap for deployments. TODO comments are in `chart/charts/<microservice>/templates/deployment.yaml`

- Commented out `nodeSelector` field in `chart/charts/backend/values.yaml`

- Created two PersistentVolumeClaims at `chart/charts/iso-master/templates/pvc.yaml`
