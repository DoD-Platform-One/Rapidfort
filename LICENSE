End-User License Agreement 
PLEASE READ THIS END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (“TERMS”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE LICENSED PRODUCTS OFFERED BY RAPIDFORT, INC. (“RAPIDFORT”).  CUSTOMER (“CUSTOMER”) AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS (TOGETHER WITH THE MASTER AGREEMENT, THE “AGREEMENT”) TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS.  IF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO SUCH TERMS.

Licensed Products

Subject to Customer’s compliance with these Terms, RapidFort grants Customer a limited, personal, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, nonexclusive license during the Term to use internally the licensed product(s) specified in the Agreement (collectively, the “Licensed Product,” or “Licensed Products”) during the Term (as defined below) for the internal business purposes of Customer, only as provided herein and only in accordance with RapidFort’s applicable official user documentation (the “Documentation”).  RapidFort shall provide access to the Licensed Products solely pursuant to one or more license key(s) delivered to Customer for the applicable Licensed Product. Customer acknowledges that any Licensed Products provided to Customer without charge (a) may have limited features, functions, or other limitations of any kind, and may not be functional or may not operate correctly; (b) may not be at the level of performance or compatibility of generally available version of the Licensed Products; and (c) may be modified from time to time without notice. 

Support & Maintenance; Upgrades

From time to time, RapidFort may provide upgrades, patches, enhancements, or fixes for the Licensed Products to its customers generally without additional charge (“Updates”), and such Updates will become part of the Licensed Products and subject to these Terms; provided that RapidFort shall have no obligation under these Terms or otherwise to provide any such Updates. Customer understands that RapidFort may cease supporting old versions or releases of the Licensed Products at any time in its sole discretion; provided that RapidFort shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give Customer prior notice of any major changes.

Ownership; Feedback

As between the parties, RapidFort retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Licensed Products, and all software, products, works, and other intellectual property and moral rights related thereto or created, used, or provided by RapidFort for the purposes of this Agreement, including any copies and derivative works of the foregoing.  Any software which is distributed or otherwise provided to Customer hereunder shall be deemed a part of the “Licensed Products” and subject to these Terms.  RapidFort grants no rights or licenses to Customer except for those rights and licenses expressly and unambiguously set forth in these Terms.  From time to time Customer may, but is not obligated to, provide suggestions, comments or other feedback to RapidFort with respect to the Licensed Products or RapidFort’s business (“Feedback”).  Feedback, even if designated as confidential by Customer, shall not create any confidentiality obligation for RapidFort notwithstanding anything else.  Customer shall, and hereby does, grant to RapidFort a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid up license to use, modify and exploit the Feedback for any purpose.  Nothing in this Agreement will impair RapidFort’s right to develop, acquire, license, market, promote or distribute products, software or technologies that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with any products, software or technologies that Customer may develop, produce, market, or distribute.

Equipment

The Customer server(s) (and related or peripheral equipment and software) on which the Licensed Product is to be installed (the “Equipment”).    Customer will maintain the Equipment in good working order (including but not limited to backup, recovery, and reboot services as necessary).  Customer will have full responsibility for security of all Equipment (physical, electronic and otherwise) such that no person or entity other than Customer will have any direct or indirect access to any Licensed Product. RapidFort will have no obligation to insure or be responsible for any loss or damage to property of any kind owned or leased by Customer or its employees, contractors, and agents. Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, Customer upon request, will confirm removal of all RapidFort property, including but not limited to Licensed Product.

Additional Restrictions

Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, Customer shall not (and shall not permit any third party to), directly or indirectly: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of the Licensed Product (except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction); (b) modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Licensed Product; (c) copy, rent, lease, distribute, pledge, assign, or otherwise transfer or encumber rights to the Licensed Product; (d) use the Licensed Product for the benefit of a third party; (e) remove or otherwise alter any proprietary notices or labels from the Licensed Product or any portion thereof; (f) use the Licensed Product to build an application or product that is competitive with any RapidFort product or service; (g) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Licensed Product or any activities conducted on the Licensed Product;  (h) bypass any measures (including license keys) RapidFort may use to prevent or restrict access to the Licensed Product (or other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to the Licensed Product); or (i) violate any applicable law or regulation, or any third party intellectual property, proprietary, or contractual rights, in connection with these Terms or Customer’s use of the Licensed Product. Customer is responsible for all of Customer’s activity in connection with the Licensed Product, including but not limited to importing or storing data on the Licensed Product. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Licensed Products (including, without limitation, any source code contained therein to which Customer may be given access hereunder), the Documentation, and any other non-public information relating to the Licensed Products and/or the business of RapidFort  (collectively, the “RapidFort Materials”) represent valuable trade secret and confidential information of RapidFort.  Accordingly, Customer (x) shall not use any RapidFort Materials except as expressly set forth herein, (y) shall not disclose any RapidFort Materials to any third party, and (z) shall use reasonable efforts to prevent any such unauthorized use or disclosure (but at least the same efforts that Customer uses to protect its own most highly sensitive and confidential information).  Customer acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of the RapidFort Materials, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations under this Section 5, which breach may result in irreparable harm to RapidFort, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, RapidFort shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief, without the requirement of posting a bond, in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law.

Term; Termination

These Terms shall commence upon the effective date set forth in the Master Agreement (“Effective Date”), and, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Agreement, shall continue until expiration as set forth in the Master Agreement (collectively, the “Term”). In the event of a material breach of these Terms by either party, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the breaching party, provided that the breaching party does not materially cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice.  Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Customer shall promptly cease use of all applicable Licensed Products, and shall delete all copies and license keys thereof (and, upon request, shall certify such destruction in writing to RapidFort).  All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. 

Indemnification

Customer (“Indemnitor”) shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless RapidFort, its affiliates and each of its and its affiliates’ employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives (collectively, the “Indemnitee”) from all liabilities, claims, and expenses paid or payable to an unaffiliated third party (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (“Losses”), that arise from or relate to Customer’s breach of these Terms. Indemnitor’s indemnification obligations hereunder shall be conditioned upon the Indemnitee providing the Indemnitor with: (i) prompt written notice of any claim (provided that a failure to provide such notice shall only relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnity obligations if the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure); (ii) the option to assume sole control over the defense and settlement of any claim (provided that the Indemnitee may participate in such defense and settlement at its own expense); and (iii) reasonable information and assistance in connection with such defense and settlement (at the Indemnitor’s expense).
